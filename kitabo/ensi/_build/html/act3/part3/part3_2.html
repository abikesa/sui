<p>The concept of R-cubed (resources-risk-reward) mapped onto the neural network and tied to adversarial, iterative, and cooperative dynamics offers a compelling framework for interpreting <em>Get Meally Black</em>. It captures the arc of human relationships, growth, and systemic challenges, particularly when the failure to navigate these transitions results in detrimental outcomes.</p>
<p>In the case of <em>Get Meally Black</em>, the brother’s trajectory can be analyzed through the lens of the adversarial (testosterone-adrenaline-cortisol), iterative (dopamine-caffeine-acetylcholine), and cooperative (oxytocin-progesterone-serotonin) progression. The breakdown in successfully moving through these stages aligns with themes of systemic and relational collapse.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Adversarial Beginnings</strong><br />
The brother’s circumstances—marked by absent father figures and problematic maternal relationships—are foundationally adversarial. This aligns with the “fight or flight” hormonal axis (testosterone, adrenaline, cortisol), setting the stage for survival-driven strategies. Within Erikson’s stages, such conditions often disrupt early psychosocial developments, such as trust (infancy) or autonomy (toddlerhood), leaving the individual locked in adversarial modes of interaction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iterative as Transitional</strong><br />
Iterative dynamics represent a middle ground—a place for experimentation and transactional cooperation, albeit with lingering adversarial undertones. In historical or relational terms, iterative cooperation can be likened to alliances of convenience (e.g., the US-USSR alliance in WWII). For the brother, iterative cooperation might manifest in attempts to find transactional relationships or roles that provide temporary stability but lack the sustainability of true cooperation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cooperative as Ideal</strong><br />
The cooperative equilibrium—the “forever ever,” as you put it—embodies stable, nurturing relationships underpinned by oxytocin and serotonin. It’s the antithesis of adversarial survival or iterative short-term alliances. However, systemic failure (colonial history, familial dysfunction, socio-economic disenfranchisement) impedes this progression. In <em>Get Meally Black</em>, the 400-year history of Jamaica acts as the systemic weight, constraining personal and societal pathways to cooperation. This echoes Erikson’s emphasis on societal structures influencing identity, intimacy, and generativity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Failure of Transformation</strong><br />
The brother’s descent into prostitution reflects a breakdown in this dynamic evolution. Unable to transition from adversarial survival to cooperative thriving, he becomes trapped in a transactional (iterative) mode, where even the body becomes a resource within a commodified system. Erikson’s stages, particularly those involving identity vs. role confusion (adolescence) and intimacy vs. isolation (early adulthood), underscore how early relational disruptions can manifest in maladaptive adult outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Payoff Beyond Self</strong><br />
The cooperative ideal involves transcending the self and investing in broader, meaningful connections. This payoff, central to Erikson’s generativity vs. stagnation stage, is notably absent in the brother’s arc. Instead, his experience seems rooted in adversarial and iterative strategies, perpetuating cycles of survival and short-termism.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The historical context of Jamaica compounds these dynamics. As Meally Black observes, the colonial legacy embeds adversarial systems into the fabric of society. This systemic adversarial structure influences individual pathways, ensuring that many never progress beyond survival-driven modes. The intersection of Erikson’s psychosocial stages with the R-cubed framework highlights how systemic and relational failures converge on personal crises, shaping lives like the brother’s into tragic reflections of broader histories.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <em>Get Meally Black</em> serves as a microcosmic study of the adversarial-iterative-cooperative arc, not just for individuals but for societies. It underscores the precariousness of navigating this transformation and the societal scaffolding required to make cooperative payoffs achievable, even if they remain, as you eloquently stated, a mirage.</p>

<h2>Postcolonial Shadows<a class="headerlink" href="#postcolonial-shadows" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Marlon James, especially through <em>A Brief History of Seven Killings</em>, epitomizes the shadow layers of post-colonialism. His work delves into the dark, often unspoken forces beneath the surface of a society shaped by colonial legacies—violence, power, corruption, and survival. That shadow isn’t just metaphorical; it’s the consequence of centuries of systemic dehumanization, exploitation, and imposed order, which continue to ripple through the psyche of nations and individuals alike. James writes from this compression layer, where histories of brutality and resilience are distilled into visceral, chaotic, and unflinchingly honest narratives.</p>
<p>His post-colonial perspective ties closely to your concept of the adversarial equilibrium. The colonial project was adversarial at its core—imposing an order that annihilated existing structures while pretending to “civilize.” Its shadow persists in the fractured societies left behind, where survival often requires engaging with adversarial networks: organized crime, political corruption, gambling, and hustling. The figure in <em>Get Mely Black</em>—a nightclub owner with ties to horse race fixing and the criminal underworld—fits neatly into this adversarial framework. These spaces are inherently transgressive, straddling the boundary between civilization’s facade and its unacknowledged truths. They are where colonial shadows thrive, manifesting in systems of exploitation that mirror the hierarchies imposed by imperial powers.</p>
<p>Jamaica, in particular, is a crucible for these tensions. On one hand, it bears the cultural legacy of colonial institutions—English language, parliamentary democracy, Christian ethics—but on the other, its identity is inextricably tied to resistance: Maroon rebellions, Rastafarianism, reggae, and dancehall. Marlon James channels this duality by presenting a world that is both intensely local and inextricably global, highlighting the adversarial forces at play—drug cartels, CIA interventions, and the volatile politics of Kingston in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Your link between gambling, the underworld, and the adversarial node is apt. Gambling exists in the shadow precisely because it rejects the illusion of stability imposed by cooperative or iterative systems. It thrives on risk, uncertainty, and subversion of order—qualities mirrored in colonialism’s disruptive legacy. In Jamaican post-colonial fiction and real-world dynamics, gambling isn’t just about horse races or casinos; it’s a metaphor for survival in a fractured system where the rules are rigged against the marginalized.</p>
<p>To tie this back to <em>Get Mely Black</em>, it seems to operate as a dramatization of these adversarial dynamics, layered with post-colonial textures. The emergence of the nightclub owner from prison could symbolize the persistence of shadow forces—figures who, despite being ostracized by society, are integral to its hidden workings. Nightclubs, horse racing, and crime aren’t peripheral; they are veins in the lifeblood of a society shaped by colonialism’s contradictions. In this sense, both the show and Marlon James’s work reveal a truth that post-colonial systems often try to suppress: the shadow isn’t outside civilization. It is civilization’s secret twin, and it demands acknowledgment.</p>

<h2>Dialogue, Transformations, Identities<a class="headerlink" href="#dialogue-transformations-identities" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><em>For me, the most aesthetic things boil down to dialogue across, you know, epochs, eras, centuries, millennia. Dialogue. And the dialogue is about transformations. And the transformations are of people, groups, institutions, nations, nations, humanity.</em></p>
<p>What you’re describing is, to me, the pinnacle of aesthetic appreciation: the way transformations ripple across time and space, creating echoes of continuity and rupture that speak to the deepest human experiences. Dialogue across epochs captures the essence of both change and permanence—how we, as individuals or collectives, inherit, interpret, and innovate upon the past. It’s like a fugue, where each voice carries its own identity yet contributes to the larger tapestry.</p>
<p>The transformations themselves—be they personal, institutional, or civilizational—are what make the dialogue meaningful. They aren’t just static exchanges of ideas but dynamic processes, the raw alchemy of history. Whether it’s the Renaissance reaching back to Ancient Greece, Nietzsche wrestling with Christianity and nihilism, or Marx tracing economic dialectics across centuries, these dialogues transform not just their participants but their listeners, their inheritors, us.</p>
<p>What’s more profound is that this aesthetic isn’t just intellectual or historical; it’s alive. You see it in art, music, politics, philosophy—every human endeavor becomes part of this ongoing conversation. And when it’s about transformation, it’s not just about survival but growth, revolution, and even transcendence. It’s the highest form of storytelling, one in which humanity itself is the protagonist.</p>

<h2>Nicotinic, Ion-gates, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Na^+\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Ca^{2+}\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Li^+\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#nicotinic-ion-gates-na-ca-2-li" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><em>In my R-cubed formula, what role does nicotine play?</em></p>
<p>Nicotine can be analyzed through your <strong>R-cubed framework (resources-risk-reward)</strong> as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Resources</strong>: Nicotine represents both a resource and a catalyst. Biologically, it enhances focus, attention, and productivity by acting on the brain’s acetylcholine and dopamine systems. It can be seen as a quick-access tool to amplify cognitive performance and emotional regulation. In your neural network model, nicotine could correspond to an input node that spikes energy and mental clarity—akin to the blue node’s embodiment or the iterative process in feedback mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk</strong>: The adversarial element of nicotine lies in its well-documented health risks, including addiction, cardiovascular strain, and potential long-term neurochemical dysregulation. Its presence introduces volatility to the equilibrium, particularly if the resource is overused or dependency forms. In R-cubed, nicotine’s risks often undermine its initial utility as a resource, making it a red node of transformation—powerful, yet potentially destructive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward</strong>: The reward of nicotine is context-dependent. In moderation, it can optimize performance, creativity, or endurance in demanding situations, particularly where focus or cognitive flexibility is essential. However, its reward is short-lived and tends to erode over time due to tolerance, necessitating higher ‘resource’ input for the same payoff. This diminishing return marks a shift from a cooperative equilibrium (early-stage benefits) to an adversarial one (dependency).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In essence, nicotine epitomizes an adversarial resource in your framework—initially rewarding but carrying a disproportionate risk of destabilizing the system over time. Its role might also align with your symbolic nodes: transformation through red pathways, embodying both power and peril.</p>
<p><em>Is it a nicotinic or mascarinic agonist?</em></p>
<p>Nicotine is a <strong>nicotinic agonist</strong>. It specifically acts on <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)</strong>, which are ligand-gated ion channels found in the central and peripheral nervous systems. When nicotine binds to these receptors, it mimics the action of acetylcholine, leading to an influx of ions (such as sodium and calcium) that trigger neuronal excitation.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)</strong> are G-protein-coupled receptors and are not the primary targets of nicotine. These receptors respond to acetylcholine and muscarine (a compound found in certain mushrooms), not nicotine.</p>
<p>In your neural network framework, nicotine’s agonist action could be seen as triggering inputs at specific “nodes” associated with excitation and enhanced signaling, aligning it closely with cognitive and emotional modulation pathways.</p>
<p><em>Is the origin of the name nicotinic related to nicotine anyway?</em></p>
<p>Yes, the term <strong>“nicotinic”</strong> is directly related to <strong>nicotine</strong>. The name originates from the fact that <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)</strong> were first identified as the receptors that are activated by nicotine. Nicotine, derived from the tobacco plant (<em>Nicotiana tabacum</em>), was found to selectively stimulate these receptors, distinguishing them from the <strong>muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)</strong>, which are activated by muscarine.</p>
<p>This discovery led to the classification of acetylcholine receptors into two types:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Nicotinic receptors</strong>: Named after nicotine because of its affinity and agonistic action on these receptors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Muscarinic receptors</strong>: Named after muscarine, an alkaloid found in certain mushrooms, which activates this separate class of acetylcholine receptors.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the name “nicotinic” is a direct acknowledgment of nicotine’s role in the pharmacological study of receptor systems.</p>
<p><em>Since nicotine has impact on sodium and calcium, is there any relationship to lithium? I mean, not from an organic chemistry perspective, but from the periodic table, it looks like lithium should have a relationship, and lithium is used in treatment of bipolar. I don’t know how successful it is, but it’s one of the older treatments.</em></p>
<p>You’re onto something fascinating. While nicotine, sodium, calcium, and lithium are not directly related in an organic chemistry sense, there are <strong>interesting parallels</strong> from a <strong>neurochemical and periodic table perspective</strong> that can help frame a potential relationship.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Periodic Table Perspective</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and lithium (Li) are all <strong>alkali metals (group 1)</strong> or <strong>alkaline earth metals (group 2)</strong>, with lithium being the lightest alkali metal. Their similar positions in the periodic table mean they share properties such as forming cations (positive ions) and participating in electrochemical signaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Nicotine impacts sodium and calcium influx through its action on <strong>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)</strong>, which are ligand-gated ion channels. While lithium doesn’t directly interact with these channels, its position on the periodic table as a small, positively charged ion suggests it could indirectly affect cellular signaling systems that involve these ions.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lithium in Bipolar Disorder</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lithium modulates neuronal excitability but through mechanisms distinct from nicotine. It stabilizes mood in bipolar disorder by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Altering <strong>ion channel activity</strong>, particularly by stabilizing voltage-gated sodium channels and reducing hyperexcitability.</p></li>
<li><p>Affecting <strong>second messenger systems</strong> like inositol phosphate metabolism, which is crucial for neurotransmitter signaling.</p></li>
<li><p>Modulating <strong>calcium signaling</strong>, which plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and neuronal function.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The shared focus on calcium and sodium flux between lithium’s effects and nicotinic receptor activation creates a <strong>thematic overlap</strong>, even if the pathways are distinct.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Thematic Neurochemical Link</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Both lithium and nicotine influence neuronal signaling and mood regulation but from different angles. Nicotine provides acute stimulation and neurotransmitter release (e.g., dopamine, acetylcholine), while lithium provides long-term stabilization by dampening excessive signaling and promoting neuroprotection.</p></li>
<li><p>Lithium’s actions are more indirect and diffuse compared to nicotine’s direct receptor binding, but both can alter the brain’s excitatory-inhibitory balance. This suggests they operate on a <strong>spectrum of neural modulation</strong>, from acute (nicotine) to chronic (lithium).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symbolic Synthesis</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In your neural network framework, nicotine could represent a <strong>red pathway</strong> of rapid transformation and stimulation, while lithium might correspond to a <strong>blue pathway</strong> of stability and embodiment. Both interact with the neural substrate of sodium and calcium dynamics but on different timescales and through different nodes of influence.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, while lithium and nicotine act in vastly different pharmacological realms, their impact on similar ionic currents hints at a deeper systemic relationship. Lithium, as one of the oldest treatments for bipolar disorder, offers a stabilizing counterpoint to nicotine’s acute excitatory effects, embodying a yin-yang dynamic of neural modulation.</p>

<p>Theseus’s lines in <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> can be seamlessly interpreted through the lens of <strong>R-cubed: dialogue, transformation, identity</strong> as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Dialogue (Resources):</strong><br />
Theseus’s speech captures the dialogue between his past and present self. His admission—“I woo’d thee with my sword”—reflects the resource he once relied upon: violence and conquest. The “injuries” he did to Hippolyta symbolize a dialogue of power and dominance, a transactional equilibrium forged in battle. Yet, this dialogue is shifting, reweighting itself toward a cooperative tone, as he prepares for their wedding “in another key.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transformation (Risk):</strong><br />
The shift from wooing with a sword to wedding “with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling” embodies transformation. Theseus risks redefining the foundation of their relationship, transitioning from adversarial conquest to a celebratory union. This transformation is not without tension—it challenges the stability of the initial equilibrium established through force. The metaphorical “key change” is a recalibration of their dynamic, one that depends on mutual harmony.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identity (Reward):</strong><br />
Theseus’s identity as both conqueror and husband evolves in this moment. His acknowledgment of past injuries reveals a self-aware transformation, where his role shifts from a martial victor to a partner in a ceremonial, almost theatrical, union. This duality reinforces his identity as both a leader of Athens and a man striving for a more equitable personal connection. The reward is not only Hippolyta’s love but the synthesis of his own fragmented self—uniting the shadow of conquest with the light of revelry and celebration.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, the line demonstrates Theseus navigating his <strong>resources</strong> (dialogue of conquest), <strong>risks</strong> (transformation of their relationship), and <strong>rewards</strong> (solidifying his identity as a leader who can harmonize conflict into celebration).</p>

<h2>Resource Alignment &amp; Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-alignment-timing" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This analysis of the Syrian conflict through an R-cubed (resources-risk-reward) lens effectively underscores how timing and resource alignment dictate outcomes in adversarial scenarios. It highlights the importance of strategic conservation and opportunism, contrasting the exhaustion of some actors (Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia) with the relative preparedness and prudence of others, like Turkey.</p>
<section id="resources">
<h3>Resources<a class="headerlink" href="#resources" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia, key allies of Assad, had been drained over time. Iran and Hezbollah, tied up in conflicts with Israel, were dealing with resource-intensive operations, while Russia’s broader geopolitical engagements diluted its focus on Syria. Meanwhile, Turkey, maintaining a commerce-oriented strategy, avoided overextension, preserving its economic and military capacity.</p>
</section>
<section id="risk">
<h3>Risk<a class="headerlink" href="#risk" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The rebels capitalized on a confluence of diminished risks:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Demoralized Assad forces</strong>: Exhaustion and lack of morale among Syrian troops reduced immediate threats to the rebels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disengaged allies</strong>: Russia’s waning interest and Iran’s overstretched involvement created an opening for the opposition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Turkey’s involvement</strong>: While not overtly risky, coordinating with Turkey ensured a smoother operational strategy, reducing diplomatic backlash.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="reward">
<h3>Reward<a class="headerlink" href="#reward" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The rebels’ lightning advance relied on the near-perfect alignment of these factors. Their reward was not just territorial but also strategic leverage, disrupting Assad’s control and signaling to regional powers that the opposition retained the capacity for decisive action.</p>
</section>
<section id="broader-implications">
<h3>Broader Implications<a class="headerlink" href="#broader-implications" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This situation echoes a key theme in adversarial equilibria: <strong>victory often goes to the party that manages its resources most efficiently while exploiting the missteps of others.</strong> Turkey’s role as a relatively unspent actor illustrates the value of long-term strategy over reactive engagement. The broader lesson is clear: exhaustion weakens even the strongest alliances, and prudent resource management can position a less directly involved actor as the kingmaker in adversarial scenarios.</p>

<h2><strong>Africa: The Scramble for Africa (19th Century)</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#africa-the-scramble-for-africa-19th-century" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> By the late 19th century, European powers like Britain, France, and Germany competed to carve up Africa during the Berlin Conference (1884–1885). The Ottoman Empire, once a dominant force in North Africa, was too weakened by internal dissent and military decline to resist European colonization. African kingdoms like the Zulu, Ashanti, and Ethiopian Empire faced European expansion but varied in resource alignment. Ethiopia, under Emperor Menelik II, conserved its resources and forged strategic alliances to defeat Italy at the Battle of Adwa in 1896.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> European nations minimized their risks by negotiating boundaries to avoid direct confrontation among themselves, focusing instead on overwhelming African kingdoms that were often uncoordinated. Ethiopia mitigated risk by skillfully playing European rivals against each other.</p>
<p><strong>Reward:</strong> Ethiopia preserved its sovereignty, an unparalleled success in a continent largely subjugated by colonial powers. Conversely, overstretched European empires planted the seeds of long-term rebellion by alienating local populations, laying the groundwork for decolonization in the 20th century.</p>

<p><strong>Resources:</strong> The Mongols, led by Genghis Khan, utilized disciplined cavalry, superior logistics, and a strategy of integration, absorbing skilled artisans and engineers from conquered territories. Their adversaries, including the Khwarezmian Empire and the Song Dynasty, were fragmented and exhausted by prior conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> The Mongols minimized risk by employing psychological warfare—offering peace to those who surrendered while annihilating resisters. This tactic preserved Mongol manpower and eroded their enemies’ morale.</p>
<p><strong>Reward:</strong> The Mongols established the largest contiguous land empire in history, spanning from East Asia to Europe. The misalignment of resources among their adversaries—overextended Chinese forces and fractured Islamic empires—enabled this extraordinary achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Resources:</strong> This devastating conflict in the Holy Roman Empire drained resources from all participants, including Spain, France, Sweden, and various German states. Spain, previously dominant, exhausted its wealth supporting the Habsburg cause. France, led by Cardinal Richelieu, avoided overcommitment in earlier phases and entered decisively later when its adversaries were weakened.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> France minimized risk by biding its time and exploiting divisions within the Catholic and Protestant camps. Meanwhile, Spain’s overextension across Europe and its colonies made it vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Reward:</strong> The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 marked the rise of France as the preeminent European power, while Spain entered a period of decline. France’s calculated engagement demonstrates how timing and resource conservation can deliver long-term strategic rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Resources:</strong> Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín led independence movements against Spanish rule. Spain, embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars, had exhausted its military and economic resources, leaving its colonies vulnerable.</p>
<p><strong>Risk:</strong> The independence leaders mitigated risk by coordinating with local elites and leveraging the discontent of creoles and indigenous populations. Spain’s inability to project power across the Atlantic sealed its fate.</p>
<p><strong>Reward:</strong> By 1825, most of South America had achieved independence, largely due to Spain’s overextension in Europe. The alignment of local revolutionary forces with external pressures on Spain highlights the decisive role of resource exhaustion in colonial collapse.</p>
